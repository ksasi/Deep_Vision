##### ASSIGNMENT 23

- Implement the following:
  - Use dlib Face Detector 
  - **Align the face using 5-pt detector and align (take a 5 second video of your face with some translation and rotation** (not extreme)
  - Calculate 68-pt landmark on the aligned faces
  - Calculate the optical flow for these 68-pts every frame
  - Stabilize the optical flow using LK method as we discussed. 
  - Create a 5 second video, with three windows:
    - First: Original frame
    - Aligned Frame with unstabilized points
    - Aligned Frame with stabilzed points. 
    - If the original video was 400x400 resolution, final video is 1200x400. Final video is 5 seconds and we need to see all 3 videos side by side for comparison. 
  - Upload to youtube, and embed the video in your readme file. 
  - Share the link. 
- This is a group of 4 assignment. All 4 **CAN** share same code and same video or different too.
